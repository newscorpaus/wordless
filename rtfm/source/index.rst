Introduction
############

Wordless is an opinionated WordPress plugin + starter theme that dramatically
speeds up and enhances your custom theme creation. Some of its features are:

* A structured, organized and clean theme organization
* **Scaffold** a new theme directly within wp-cli
* Write PHP templates with **PUG** templating language
* Write CSS stylesheets using the awesome **SCSS** syntax
* Write Javascript logic in **ES2015**
* A growing set of handy and documented PHP **helper functions** ready to be used
  within your views
* Preconfigured support to **MailHog** mail-catcher.
* Development workflow backed by **WebPack**, BrowserSync (with live reload),
  WP-CLI, Yarn. All the standards you already know, all the customizations you
  may need.

Wordless is a micro-framework for custom themes development. Thus is a product intended
for developers.

A compiled Wordless theme will run on any standard Wordpress installation.

Wordless does not alter any core functionality, thus it is compatible with reasonably
any generic plugin.
