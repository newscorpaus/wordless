Wordless is agnostic about the deploy strategy. Our favourite product for
deploying WordPress is `Wordmove`_.

By the way keep in mind that once you have built you theme with ``yarn build:prod``, the theme is
ready to be simply copied to the production server. The only requirement is to have Wordless plugin
activated.
