Wordless is a junction between a WordPress plugin and a theme boilerplate that dramatically speeds up and enhances your custom theme creation. Some of its features are:

* A structured, organized and clean [theme organization](https://wordless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_pages/usage/anatomy.html)
* Bootstrap a new theme directly within wp-cli
* Write PHP templates with [Pug templating system](https://github.com/pug-php/pug)
* Write CSS stylesheets using the awesome [SCSS syntax](http://sass-lang.com)
* Out-of-the-box support to [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) configured for SCSS syntax.
* Write Javascript logic using modern syntax thanks to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* Automatically polyfill (with [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)) and transpile Javascript based on your support inside [`.browserslistrc`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)
* A growing set of handy and documented PHP helper functions ready to be used within your views
* Preconfigured support to [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) mail-catcher in development.
* Development workflow backed by [WebPack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) (with live reload), [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). All the standards you already know, all the customizations you may need.
